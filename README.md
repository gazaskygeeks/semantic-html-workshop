# Semantic HTML and BEMCSS Workshop

Maintaining clean and organised code is a vital part of being a developer. Today, we're going to be
learning about two methodologies that can help you do this – semantic HTML and BEMCSS.

1. Pick a partner and pair up

2. Clone this repo to one of your laptops – you'll be using the other laptop for research

3. Open the repo in Atom

## Semantic HTML

Have a look at the code in `index.html` together. We're going to be refactoring it to make it more
semantic.

1. The code isn't very readable as it is  – make sure that it's properly indented.

2. Make sure you both understand what semantic HTML is and why we use it. [Take a look at this article](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/html-5-semantics/) to get you started on the right path.

3. Use what you've learned to cure `index.html` of its [divitis](http://www.apaddedcell.com/div-itis-what-it-and-how-avoid-it).

## BEMCSS

Our code might be looking good now, but the site looks a bit dull. Time to get our CSS on! We want to make sure our code stays organised, though, so we're going to be writing BEMCSS.

1. [Go here](http://getbem.com/introduction/) and read through the documentation for BEM.

2. Write your CSS in `style.css`. Feel free to style the page how you like – just make sure you use BEMCSS (HINT: this will involve changing the IDs given to you in `index.html`!)
