				<h2>Welcome to the future of learning</h2>
				<p>Founders & Coders runs tuition-free coding schools in London (since 2014) and Nazareth (beginning Spring 2017). We transform talented individuals from a variety of academic and professional backgrounds into sought-after software developers. All of our graduates find well-paid employment in software development or a related field.</p>
				<p>Our revolutionary peer-led programme begins with a 16-week immersion in full-stack JavaScript, Node.js, and Git. Working collaboratively in pairs and teams, students master the fundamentals of “agile” development practices by delivering real projects to clients such as early-stage startups and NGOs.</p>
				<p>Instead of traditional top-down instruction, Founders & Coders has mentors—former students who work from the Founders & Coders co-working space on freelance projects until they are ready to seek full-time employment.</p>
				<aside>"I did not think it was possible to learn so much in such a short time"</aside>

				<h2>Programme schedule</h2>
				<p>We run three programmes a year, starting in February, June, and October. The programme consists of a 16-week foundation followed by up to 10 weeks of working on real-world projects.</p>
				<p>Classes are peer-led and project-based with sixteen students working in four teams of four. Students take turns delivering seminars, running code reviews and managing projects.</p>
				<p>Our curriculum primarily covers test-driven development, using JavaScript and Node.js. We also cover aspects of UX design, product management and entrepreneurship.</p>
				<p>After graduation, we aim to help our students find freelance projects, so that they can hone their skills, build a project portfolio and mentor the next cohort of students</p>

				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>Founders & Coders is a nonprofit social enterprise that runs a tuition-free coding bootcamp in London. We support ourselves by providing technical expertise and training to nonprofits and early-stage startups. With the support of the UK Israel Tech Hub at the British Embassy, we are opening our first international campus in Nazareth in early 2017.</p>

				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>Founders & Coders began in 2014 when Dan Sofer, who had worked for years as a software developer and project manager, decided to take some online programming courses to refresh his skills. He started meeting regularly with other people taking similar courses, and Founders & Coders was born.</p>
				<p>Dan realised he loved peer-led learning and decided to expand the meetups by setting up a classroom space where aspiring developers could collaborate. Eager students flocked to Dan’s courses. Eventually, Dan got so busy recruiting work for his students that the programme had to run itself—and it did. Former students provided critical mentorship and curricular guidance. Founders & Coders blossomed into a vibrant, self-organising community.</p>
