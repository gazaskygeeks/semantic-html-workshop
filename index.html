      <p>Why is Semantic HTML So Important?</p>
      <p>Writing semantic HTML brings a wide range of benefits:</p>
      <p>Ease of use</p>
      <p>Accessibility</p>
      <p>Search Engine Optimisation</p>

        Semantic HTML is much easier to read and edit than markup that's littered with inline styling
        and generic tags. It makes you think more about the layout and content of your pages and
        write cleaner code, which helps developers who maintain your work after you to understand it.
        As websites and apps become more and more complex, this is only becoming more useful!

        Semantic HTML is important for accessibility reasons. Assistive technologies like screen
        readers look to semantic tags to guide them through a web page. A &ltnav&gt tag, for
        instance, specifies where the navigation section on a page lives, which allows a screen
        reader to skip reading it out. Well-ordered HTML is also important in graceful degradation,
        as it means a web page will work much better without its CSS or JavaScript.

        It's not only humans and assistive technologies that have to read your HTML; the bots that
        determine a web page's search ranking go through it too. Clean, semantic HTML results in
        a page's content making up a higher percentage of its code. This means it's easier to create
        a higher density of keywords, and therefore a higher search engine ranking.
